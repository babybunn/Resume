    "bio": "Hello! I'm Pang. I graduated from a faculty of Information Technology from King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang. I found my passion for code during high school when I started designing blogs. I’m an experienced Frontend Developer at Pronto Marketing with a demonstrated history of working in the marketing and advertising industry for 3 years. Through my experience with Pronto Marketing, I encounter and cultivate knowledge on international website design on a daily basis as the majority of our clients are based in US. I’m enthusiastic to find more opportunity to further my skills for website design and coding, therefore, I’m looking for an opportunity to work as a full stack developer.",
